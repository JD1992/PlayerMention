# PlayerMention
A spigot plugin so that users can tag other user in chat with @Username and to the mentioned user a sound is played to notify them.

This plugin was used almost over a year by a german minecraft citybuild server.

## TODO
- Move message, default value and config functionality to seperate files(more readable)
- Make defaulg language english (for example PlayerMention.java)
- Make more doc comments
- Make functionality configurable
- Add timeout between mentions
- Make sound configurable
- Add deactivation possibility, so a Team member can prevent users from using it
